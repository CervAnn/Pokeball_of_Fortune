# Pokeball of Fortune: A GameTime Adaptation of Wheel-of-Fortune

By Antonio Fry, Hanna Hyde, and Ann Cerveny


GameTime is the third project of Mod 2 in the Front-End Engineering 1903 cohort at the Turing School of Software and Design. It is a three-person group project - a collaborative effort between Ann, Hannah, and Antonio - that uses JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, the Mocha test framework, and the Chai assertion library. We were assigned the game format of Wheel of Fortune, and adapted it to a Pokemon theme that requires 3 players, and run 4 rounds before declaring a winner. The emphasis of this project resided in the interaction between JavaScript classes and objects, manipulating the DOM with jQuery, developing our skills in testing, and working in a group. 

## Setup

Should you be interesting in running this project on your local machine, please do the following:

1. Clone down the repository using the `git clone` command.
2. Change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the start page to our game. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
